I am a member of the [Knowledge Dicovery Lab](https://kdl.cs.umass.edu/index.html) at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, working with [David Jensen](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~jensen/).  My current research focuses on evaluation methods for causal modeling algorithms.  I also work on applying causal learning techniques to better understand complex systems.  I enjoy working in applied domains, and have done work in insider threat detection, jet engine maintenance forecasting, and explaining RL agent performance in Starcraft 2.
